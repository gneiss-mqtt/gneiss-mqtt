Slow Start

MqttClientOptions enum and field:

ReconnectThrottleType
  None,
  SlowStart

Add support to MqttOperation for non-packet based marker operation types

OnDisconnectionEvent:
  if reconnect_throttle is SlowStart:
     user_operation_queue.append(EndSlowStartOperation)

OnTransitionToConnected:
  if reconnect_throttle is SlowStart:
     set operation queue state to SlowStart


service_queue:
  // before acquire packet id
  handle_non_packet_operations
     set operation queue state to Unthrottled


dequeue_operation:
  // after high priority check
  if state is Connected &&
     operation queue state is SlowStart &&
     pending_ack_exist(sub_unsub, publish)
  return None   

// verify that on ack receipt (removal) we guarantee a service schedule



Max Retries support

Add max_operation_retries config field to MqttClientOptions
Add retry_count to Operation
All unacked operations have their retry_count increased on disconnect
Add a retry count check to the end of disconnection event handling, log failed publish resubmits appropriately
